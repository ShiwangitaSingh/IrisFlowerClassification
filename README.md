# IrisFlowerClassification

This project involves the classification of Iris flower species using data analysis and  machine learning.<br><br>I analyse the classic Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.<br><br>The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. <br><br>I aim to build a model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features. <br>I implemented and evaluated two models. The first model uses Logistic Regression, achieving an accuracy of 97%. The second model is a custom-built classifier that I created achieved a 96% accuracy. <br><br>
**The repository includes all necessary code for**
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training
- Evaluation
- Comparison of the models
