# IrisFlowerClassification

This project involves the classification of Iris flower species using data analysis and  machine learning.<br><br>I analyse the classic Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.<br><br>The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. <br><br>I aim to build a model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks with code, visualizations, step by step obeservations and a model.py file which contains the ML Model.<br>
