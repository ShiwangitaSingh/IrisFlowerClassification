# IrisFlowerClassification

This project involves the classification of Iris flower species using data visualization and  machine learning. I utilize the classic Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project covers data preparation, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation using various classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). I aim to build a model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks with code, visualizations, and instructions for running the models.<br>
